Parameters Configuration Module for Distributed Formation Control

This module defines and manages all simulation parameters for the distributed formation
control system. It provides a centralized configuration that can be easily modified
to adjust simulation behavior.

Configuration Parameters:
- Formation Parameters:
    - FORMATION_POINTS_NUM: Number of nodes in the formation
    - FORMATION_RADIUS: Radius of the circular formation
    - FORMATION_CENTER_X/Y: Center coordinates of the formation
    - MISSION_ALTITUDE: Operating altitude of the formation

- Communication Parameters:
    - COMMUNICATION_TRANSMISSION_RANGE: Maximum communication range
    - COMMUNICATION_DELAY: Communication delay between nodes
    - COMMUNICATION_FAILURE_RATE: Probability of communication failure

- Simulation Parameters:
    - SIMULATION_DURATION: Total simulation time
    - SIMULATION_DEBUG: Debug mode flag
    - SIMULATION_REAL_TIME: Real-time simulation flag
    - UPDATE_RATE: Rate of simulation updates

- State Vectors:
    - SHAPE_VECTOR: Current formation shape
    - STATUS_VECTOR: Node status information
    - CORRECT_VECTOR: Correctness indicators

Usage:
    from parameters import Parameters
    params = Parameters()
    # Modify parameters as needed
